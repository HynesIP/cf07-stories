stories
=======

This project allows people to collaborate on making photo stories. The premise is that a set of five related photographs can be arranged in different orders to tell different stories.

This was started as a project for the Code Fellows JavaScript bootcamp, Fall 2013.

Meteor was chosen as the framework to test the concept of a full-stack JavaScript application.
